##### A note on this project:

The organization of this document probably seems strange. That's because it's part of an entire multi-part lab for ESM 206, which students will create in multiple projects (but are combined here for easier sharing). Hence the weird unrelated pieces all put together in this project (students will create Parts 2 & 3 as separate projects).

```{r, inlculde=F}
#tabset makes tabs in knitted file. fade makes the tabs fadded (not needed)

```

```{r, inlcude=F}
# the num of hastags increased by 1, which tells r that this is one of the tab headers. Anything below the heder (but before the next header), is info that goes towards this tab.

# num of hastags for headers doesnt matter(?), so long as theyre consistent
```

```{r}
#img= file path; img is from the cloned file. 

# in Git tab, the files that appear are the ones that have had changes made to them, so those are the ones availble for committing

#alaways want to work on the most recent version of file, so click "pull" in git. IF the window says "already up to date", then tou have the mosr recent version. when working with other ppl, pull frequently. communicate with collaboratros so not working on the same script at the same time, bc there will be merge conoflicts

#git shows most recent file in the repository, but it saves all uploaded versions if go to history

#read mes in git follow same formating as r markdown
